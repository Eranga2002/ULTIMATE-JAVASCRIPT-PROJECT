## Design Philosophy

NeoCalc was designed with these core principles:

1. **Beautiful Simplicity**: Clean interface with subtle depth and dimensionality
2. **Intuitive Interaction**: Natural user flow with visual and motion feedback
3. **Modern Aesthetics**: Contemporary design with attention to typography and color
4. **Responsive Adaptation**: Seamless experience across all device sizes
5. **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality works everywhere, with enhanced features where supported

## Setup

Follow these steps to set up and run the NeoCalc project on your local machine:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/deepakkumar55/ULTIMATE-JAVASCRIPT-PROJECT.git
   ```
   
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd ULTIMATE-JAVASCRIPT-PROJECT/Basic\ Projects/2-calculator
   ```

3. **Open `index.html` in Your Browser**:
   You can open the `index.html` file directly in your web browser by double-clicking on it or by using a live server extension in your code editor (like Live Server for VSCode).

4. **Customize the Application (Optional)**:
   - Modify the color scheme by updating CSS custom properties in the `:root` selector
   - Add additional calculator functions like square root, exponents, etc.
   - Extend the history functionality with export options

## Implementation Highlights

### CSS Architecture
The CSS uses modern practices with custom properties for theming:

```css
:root {
  --primary-color: #4361ee;
  --operator-color: #4361ee;
  /* Additional variables for consistent styling */
}
```

### JavaScript Architecture
The calculator uses a clean object-based architecture:

```javascript
const calculator = {
  displayValue: '0',
  firstOperand: null,
  waitingForSecondOperand: false,
  operator: null,
  // Additional properties for state management
};
```

## Docker Integration

NeoCalc includes Docker support for easy deployment and consistent environments:

```
# Steps to run the application with Docker
step 1: Pull the source code from repo.
step 2: Build the docker file with `docker build -t calculator .`
step 3: Run the container with `docker run -d -p 8080:80 --name calculator-app calculator:latest`
step 4: Access your app in browser at `http://localhost:8080`
```
