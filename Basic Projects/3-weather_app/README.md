1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/deepakkumar55/ULTIMATE-JAVASCRIPT-PROJECT.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd ULTIMATE-JAVASCRIPT-PROJECT/Basic\ Projects/3-weather_app
   ```

3. **Get an API Key**:

   - Replace the existing API key with your own key

5. **Open `index.html` in Your Browser**:
   - You can use a local development server for optimal experience
   - Alternatively, simply open the index.html file in your browser

## Implementation Highlights

### CSS Architecture
The application uses a comprehensive theming system with CSS variables:

```css
:root {
  /* Color Variables */
  --primary-color: #5372F0;
  --primary-light: #6C8EFF;
  
  /* Weather Theme Colors */
  --sunny-gradient: linear-gradient(135deg, #FF8C39, #F56036);
  --rainy-gradient: linear-gradient(135deg, #4B79A1, #283E51);
  
  /* Other design variables */
}
```

This approach enables easy theming and consistent styling throughout the application.

### JavaScript Architecture
The weather app uses modern JavaScript patterns:

```javascript
// Modular functions for specific tasks
const getWeatherIcon = (weatherId) => {
  // Logic to return appropriate weather icon
};

// Async/await for API calls
async function getWeather(city) {
  // Clean API handling with proper error management
}

// State management
let state = {
  weatherHistory: [],
  isDarkMode: false
};
```
